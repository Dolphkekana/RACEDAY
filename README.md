# RaceDay

RaceDay is an ASP.NET Core Web API for managing community sports events. The system allows organisers to create and manage events, categories, participant enrolments and race results, while participants can register, browse events, enrol in events and view their results.

The project is being developed as part of the RaceDay API assignment and follows a planning-first approach. The database design and API contract are defined before the main API implementation.
